# Coulomb's Law Simulator

A physics simulation visualizing electrostatic forces between charged particles, built in raylib.
Right now the particles self-organized into something that looks like stable molecular structures, just like ionic bonding, maybe because I added too much friction. I use the vector form of Coulomb's law to define the force: 

$$\mathbf{F} = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{|\mathbf{r}|^2} \mathbf{\hat{r}}$$

and then find the acceleration, velocity and position.

## Requirements

- C compiler (gcc)
